## Step 4: Launch and Test Your Network  

1. **Initialize the Genesis Block**:  
   ```bash  
   coin-generator init --chain-id my-chain-1  
   ```  

2. **Start Validator Nodes**:  
   ```bash  
   coin-generator start --validator-name my-validator  
   ```  

3. **Test Transactions**:  
   Use the built-in wallet to send tokens between test accounts.

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q1: Why choose PoS over PoW?**  
PoS reduces energy consumption while maintaining network security through staking incentives.  

**Q2: How much does it cost to create a cryptocurrency?**  
Basic development tools like Coin Generator are free; deployment costs vary based on network size.  

**Q3: Can I monetize my cryptocurrency?**  
Yes, through transaction fees, staking rewards, or integrating tokens into your business model.  

**Q4: Is blockchain integration legal?**  
Compliance depends on jurisdiction; consult legal experts before launch.  

**Q5: How do I attract users to my network?**  
Offer tangible utility (e.g., discounts, voting rights) and leverage social media campaigns.

## Advanced Strategies for Growth  

### Tokenomics Optimization  
Design a sustainable economy by balancing inflation rates and token utility. For example:  
- **Burn Mechanisms**: Reduce supply by burning a percentage of transaction fees.  
- **Staking APR**: Adjust rewards to maintain validator participation without oversupplying tokens.  

### Cross-Chain Interoperability  
Integrate bridges to enable compatibility with Ethereum or Cosmos ecosystems, expanding use cases.
