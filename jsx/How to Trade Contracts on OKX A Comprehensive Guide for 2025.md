# How to Trade Contracts on OKX: A Comprehensive Guide for 2025  

## Understanding Contract Trading Basics  

Contract trading enables investors to profit from cryptocurrency price fluctuations through **long (buying) or short (selling) positions**. Unlike spot trading, this approach allows gains during both bullish and bearish markets. For instance, opening a long position on BTC generates profits when prices rise, while short positions benefit from price declines.  

OKX offers two primary contract types:  
1. **Delivery Contracts** - Fixed expiration dates with automatic settlement based on average price calculations  
2. **Perpetual Contracts** - No expiration dates, with funding fees balancing market positions  

> **Pro Tip:** Perpetual contracts are particularly popular for their flexibility. When more traders hold long positions, short-side traders receive funding fees, and vice versa.

### Contract Categorization by Collateral Type  
Each contract type further divides by collateral options:  
- **USDT-Margined Contracts**: Use stablecoins as collateral  
- **Crypto-Margined Contracts**: Use native cryptocurrencies as collateral  

This dual system allows traders to choose between stablecoin stability and crypto exposure based on their risk tolerance.  

## Step-by-Step Contract Trading Process  

### 1. Account Preparation  
Before trading:  
- Enable contract trading mode in your account settings  
- Choose between **Single-Currency Margin** (dedicated collateral) or **Cross-Margin** (shared collateral pool)  

### 2. Asset Transfer  
Move funds from your funding wallet to trading account. This applies to both:  
- USDT for stablecoin-margined contracts  
- Native crypto assets for crypto-margined contracts  

### 3. Contract Selection  
Navigate to the trading interface:  
1. Use the dropdown menu to select "Delivery" or "Perpetual" contracts  
2. Choose your preferred settlement period (weekly, biweekly, quarterly) for delivery contracts  
3. Select USDT or crypto-margined options based on your collateral preference  

### 4. Position Management

- **Limit Orders**: Specify exact entry/exit prices  
- **Market Orders**: Immediate execution at current prices  

Monitor positions through the dashboard displaying:

### 5. Risk Management Tools

## Advanced Trading Strategies  

### 1. Hedging Against Market Volatility  
Use inverse positions to offset spot market risks. For example, holding BTC while opening a short BTC/USDT perpetual contract during uncertain market conditions.  

### 2. Arbitrage Opportunities  
Capitalize on price discrepancies between delivery and perpetual contracts, especially during high volatility periods.  

### 3. Funding Rate Arbitrage  
Monitor perpetual contract funding rates to identify profitable carry trades. When rates favor your position, earnings accumulate automatically every 8 hours.
