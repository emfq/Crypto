# Pepe Records 8% Gain, New Meme Coin Under $0.10 Emerges As Next Potential Gem  

Meme coins continue to dominate crypto conversations in 2025, with Pepe (PEPE) delivering an 8% weekly gain that reignited trader enthusiasm. As the broader market experiences renewed momentum, investors are now eyeing emerging projects like Snorter (SNORT) â€“ a low-cap Solana-based token priced under $0.10 that combines meme appeal with practical utility.  

## Pepeâ€™s Technical Breakout Explained  

Current Price: $0.0000097  
Weekly Gain: 8%  
Market Cap: Exceeds $4 billion  

Pepeâ€™s recent resurgence stems from both technical indicators and on-chain activity. The "Golden Cross" formation â€“ where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average â€“ has historically preceded significant rallies in cryptocurrencies. This pattern emerged last week, signaling potential bullish momentum.  

Key metrics driving Pepeâ€™s rally:  
- **Exchange Balance Decline**: On-chain data shows a 2% drop in exchange holdings since April 2025, indicating reduced sell pressure  
- **Consolidation Phase**: The token has maintained a tight trading range for two weeks, suggesting institutional accumulation before a potential breakout  
- **Whale Activity**: Large holders have increased positions by 12% according to blockchain analytics platforms

### Frequently Asked Question #1:  
**What makes the Golden Cross significant for Pepe?**  
This technical pattern demonstrates increasing buyer momentum over sellers. Historical analysis shows Pepe has rallied 20-30% post-Golden Cross events in previous market cycles, making this setup particularly noteworthy for short-to-medium term traders.  

## Broader Meme Coin Market Revival  

While Pepe leads the charge, the broader meme coin sector is experiencing synchronized growth:  
| Token | Weekly Gain | Blockchain |  
|-------|-------------|------------|  
| FARTCOIN | 22% | Solana |  
| PENGU | 55% | Ethereum |  
| PEPE | 8% | Ethereum |  

This rally correlates with Bitcoinâ€™s recent push toward $110,000, which has increased risk appetite among retail investors. Whale wallets have allocated 18% more capital to meme coins in Q2 2025 compared to the previous quarter, according to Nansen data.  

### Frequently Asked Question #2:  
**Why are meme coins rallying alongside Bitcoin?**  
Bitcoinâ€™s price action often sets the tone for altcoin seasons. When BTC approaches all-time highs, investors rotate into higher-risk assets like meme coins seeking amplified returns. The current environment shows perfect conditions for this pattern to repeat.  

## Snorter: The New Contender Combining Meme Culture with Utility  

**Presale Price**: $0.0967  
**Market Cap at Launch**: Under $2 million  
**Funds Raised**: Exceeds $1.4 million  

While established meme coins capture headlines, savvy investors are exploring undervalued opportunities. Snorter stands out through its unique blend of meme aesthetics and practical blockchain tools:  

1. **Telegram Trading Bot**:  
   - Detects scams and rug pulls in real-time  
   - Enables automated token discovery and execution  
   - Prevents front-running through MEV protection  

2. **Economic Advantages**:  
   - 243% APY staking rewards for SNORT holders  
   - Trading fee reduction from 1.5% to 0.85%  
   - 12,400+ engaged followers on social media  

The projectâ€™s whitepaper emphasizes its commitment to avoiding pump-and-dump schemes, with 60% of tokens allocated to liquidity pools and 25% to community development.  

### Frequently Asked Question #3:  
**How does Snorterâ€™s trading bot differentiate it from other meme coins?**  
While most meme coins rely solely on community hype, Snorter addresses real pain points in decentralized trading. Its bot provides institutional-grade tools to retail users, creating sustainable utility that could drive long-term adoption.  

## Investment Considerations for 2025  

As meme coins evolve beyond pure speculation, investors should consider these factors:  
- **Tokenomics Analysis**: Look for projects with clear token utility and reasonable supply structures  
- **On-Chain Metrics**: Monitor exchange inflows/outflows and whale accumulation patterns  
- **Technical Patterns**: Watch for Golden Cross signals across meme coin charts

### Frequently Asked Question #4:  
**Is Snorter a safer investment than typical meme coins?**  
Snorter introduces utility components that reduce its correlation with speculative market cycles. However, all meme coins carry inherent volatility risks. The projectâ€™s Telegram bot integration and staking rewards create potential for sustainable growth if adoption expands.  

## Market Outlook for July 2025  

With Bitcoin approaching critical resistance levels and traditional finance institutions showing increased interest in meme coin ETFs, July could witness significant price movements. Historical data shows that 75% of major meme coin rallies occur within 60 days of Bitcoin reaching new highs.  

Key watchlist for traders:  
- **Pepe**: Potential breakout above $0.000010 if Golden Cross momentum continues  
- **Snorter**: Watch for volume spikes coinciding with Telegram bot launch  
- **Sector Rotation**: Monitor ETH/BTC ratio changes that might impact Solana-based tokens like Snorter  

### Frequently Asked Question #5:  
**What risks should investors be aware of?**  
Meme coins remain highly volatile assets. Regulatory uncertainty, market sentiment shifts, and technical vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose risks. Diversification and strict risk management practices are essential when allocating capital to this sector.  

By combining technical analysis, utility-driven projects, and macro market trends, investors can position themselves for potential opportunities in this evolving landscape.
