## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: What programming languages are essential for blockchain development?
A1: Key languages include Solidity (Ethereum), Go (Hyperledger), Python (prototyping), and Rust (high-performance chains). Each language serves specific purposes in different blockchain ecosystems.

### Q2: How do I validate blockchain transactions?
A2: Transaction validation involves cryptographic signature verification, checking against consensus rules, and ensuring proper Merkle tree structure. Tools like **[OKX's blockchain explorer](https://bit.ly/okx-bonus)** help visualize this process.

### Q3: What's the difference between public and private blockchains?
A3: Public blockchains are permissionless and decentralized (e.g., Ethereum), while private blockchains restrict access (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric). The choice depends on use cases requiring different levels of transparency and control.

### Q4: How can I learn blockchain development effectively?
A4: Combine theoretical learning with hands-on practice. Start with **basic tutorials**, progress to **full-stack dApp development**, and participate in open-source projects for real-world experience.
