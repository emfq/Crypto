## About PulseChain (PLS)  

**PulseChain** is a public blockchain engineered for fast, low-cost transactions.

The native token, **$PLS**, serves as the lifeblood of the ecosystem, enabling transaction fees, staking, and governance participation. Its creator, **Richard Heart**, previously gained attention for launching HEX, another controversial cryptocurrency. PulseChain aims to address Ethereumâ€™s high gas fees and slower transaction speeds, positioning itself as a viable alternative for developers and traders.
