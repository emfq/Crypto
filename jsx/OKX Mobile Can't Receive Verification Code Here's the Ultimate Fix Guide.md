### 2. Verify Phone Number Accuracy  

Even minor number errors can cause verification failures:  

- Confirm country code format (e.g., +1 for the US)  
- Check for typos in the registered number  
- Ensure the number is active and capable of receiving SMS  
- Test by sending a test message through your phone's messaging app  

### 3. Manage Request Frequency  

OKX implements rate-limiting for security:  

| Time Interval | Maximum Requests |  
|---------------|------------------|  
| 1 minute      | 1 request        |  
| 5 minutes     | 3 requests       |  
| 15 minutes    | 5 requests       |  

Wait at least 15 minutes between consecutive failed attempts to avoid temporary blocks.  

### 4. Adjust SMS Filtering Settings  

Modern smartphones often block "non-personal" messages:  

**For Android Users:**  
1. Open Messages app > Settings > Spam filter  
2. Add *OKX* to contact list or disable filtering  

**For iOS Users:**  
1. Settings > Messages > Unknown & Spam  
2. Disable "Filter Unknown Senders"
