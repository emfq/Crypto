# Spain Cryptoasset Regulation Snapshot  

Spain's regulatory landscape for cryptoassets is evolving rapidly as the European Union implements the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. This framework harmonizes rules across EU member states while introducing specific requirements for Spain's domestic authorities. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the current regulatory environment.  

## Key Regulatory Bodies  

### Spanish Securities Market Commission (CNMV)  
The CNMV oversees cryptoassets classified as financial instruments and supervises cryptoasset service providers under MiCA (excluding e-money tokens and asset-reference tokens). Its responsibilities include:  
- Authorizing and monitoring cryptoasset service providers.  
- Regulating financial promotions of cryptoassets.  
- Enforcing compliance with risk disclosure requirements.  

### Bank of Spain  
The Bank of Spain regulates issuers of e-money tokens (EMTs) and asset-reference tokens (ARTs), focusing on stability and monetary policy implications.  

## National Legislation and MiCA Implementation  

Spain has integrated EU directives and national laws to regulate cryptoassets, including:  
- **Cryptoasset promotions**: Governed by Circular 1/2022, requiring clear, balanced advertising with risk warnings.  
- **DLT applications**: Law 6/2023 permits distributed ledger technology (DLT) for issuing financial instruments.  
- **Anti-money laundering (AML)**: Law 10/2010 mandates AML compliance for virtual asset service providers (VASPs).

### Stablecoin Regulations  
Stablecoins fall under MiCA's dual classification as "asset-referenced tokens" or "electronic money tokens." While Spain lacks standalone stablecoin laws, existing frameworks apply to promotional activities and e-money regulations.  

## Advertising Rules for Cryptoassets  

Spain enforces stringent advertising standards to protect investors:  
- **Scope**: Applies to promotions targeting Spanish investors, excluding NFTs and corporate branding campaigns.  
- **Requirements**:  
  - Clear, non-misleading content with risk disclosures.  
  - Links to detailed risk information.  
  - Ex-post CNMV oversight for most ads; ex-ante approval for campaigns reaching >100,000 people.  

### Enforcement Example  
In February 2024, the CNMV imposed fines totaling â‚¬30,000 for non-compliant crypto ads lacking risk warnings and advance notifications.  

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Requirements  

Spain aligns with the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5MLD) and national laws:  
- **Registration**: VASPs must register with the Bank of Spain.  
- **Obligations**: Customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and reporting suspicious activities.  
- **Future Changes**: Spain plans to expand AML coverage to include additional crypto service providers under MiCA.  

## Banking Sector and Cryptoassets  

Spanish banks face no explicit restrictions on cryptoasset dealings but must comply with:  
- **MiFID II**: For cryptoassets classified as financial instruments.  
- **Prudential rules**: Pending implementation of Basel Committee standards on crypto exposures.  

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)  

Current Spanish law does not regulate genuinely decentralized platforms, though MiCA's extraterritorial provisions may indirectly apply.  

## Regulatory and Criminal Enforcement  

### High-Profile Cases  
- **CNMV Penalties**: First known fines in February 2024 for non-compliant advertising.  
- **Criminal Investigations**: A â‚¬92 million fraud case involving 32,000 individuals and cryptocurrency ATM money laundering operations.
