## Step-by-Step Guide to Using the ROI Calculator

### 1. General Configuration
Begin by setting up your mining profile:
- **Setup Name**: Assign a custom identifier for your rig.
- **Electricity Cost**: Input your local energy rate (e.g., $0.12/kWh).
- **Currency Preference**: Choose your preferred fiat or cryptocurrency.
- **Target Coin**: Select from ETH, RVN, BEAM, or ETC for analysis.

ðŸ’¡ *Pro Tip: Electricity costs account for 40-70% of mining expenses. Accurate input here significantly improves calculation reliability.*

### 2. Mining Hardware Specification
Add your GPU inventory with precision:
- **Example Setup**: 6 x NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPUs at â‚¬700 each, delivering 98 MH/s hash rate at 220W power consumption.
- **Bulk Management**: Duplicate or delete rows to adjust for rig size changes.

#### Comparative Hashrate Table (Sample)
| GPU Model      | Hashrate (MH/s) | Power (W) | Efficiency (MH/W) |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| RTX 3080       | 98              | 220       | 0.445             |
| Radeon RX 6800 | 120             | 250       | 0.48              |
| RTX 3060       | 60              | 170       | 0.353             |

### 3. Additional Cost Components
Account for auxiliary expenses:
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Motherboard, PSU, risers, SSD.
- **Subscription Fees**: Include minerstat's premium features or third-party monitoring tools.
- **Recovery Credits**: Deduct any returns from previous mining cycles.

## Interpreting the Results: Break-even and ROI Analysis

### Confidence Interval Scenarios
Adjust profitability ranges to model different market conditions:
- **Negative Offset**: Simulate a 20% drop in mining rewards.
- **Positive Offset**: Project gains from a 30% network difficulty decrease.

### Break-even Timeline
Discover when your investment covers costs:
- **Current Conditions**: 142 days at $0.12/kWh electricity.
- **Optimized Scenario**: 110 days with $0.08/kWh energy rates.

### ROI Projections
Track returns across multiple timeframes:
| Period   | ROI (%) |
|----------|---------|
| 1 Day    | 0.7%    |
| 1 Month  | 21%     |
| 6 Months | 126%    |
| 1 Year   | 252%    |

## Practical Applications of the ROI Calculator

### Case Study: Scaling a Mining Operation
A miner operating 10 rigs (totaling 60 RTX 3080 GPUs) used the calculator to:
1. Identify that upgrading to more efficient PSUs would reduce break-even time by 18 days.
2. Determine optimal timing for expansion based on projected ETH price increases.
3. Compare profitability across supported coins, ultimately selecting ETC for its lower network difficulty.

### Electricity Cost Sensitivity Analysis
| Energy Rate | Break-even Time | Annual ROI |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| $0.10/kWh   | 130 days        | 280%       |
| $0.15/kWh   | 165 days        | 185%       |
| $0.08/kWh   | 112 days        | 325%       |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate are the calculator's projections?
The tool provides estimates based on current market data and user inputs. While projections update every 10 minutes, actual results may vary due to price volatility and network difficulty adjustments.

### Can I calculate ROI for cryptocurrencies outside the supported list?
Currently, the calculator supports ETH, RVN, BEAM, and ETC. Users can request additional coins through minerstat's feedback system. For alternative coins, consider using the **GPU mining calculator** feature to estimate hashpower value.

### How does electricity cost impact profitability?
Electricity expenses typically represent the largest variable cost. A 30% reduction in energy rates could potentially decrease break-even time by 25-40%, as demonstrated in our comparative analysis tables.
